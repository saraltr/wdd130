      <p>Featured Article: New Technologies & Art: The Popularity of Immersive Art
        Through a thematic, intimate and introspective journey, immersive exhibitions offer unique experience to their visitors. Using animation, videos, text, and visual effects as elements of projections galleries explore approaches to engaging museum visitors. Based on observation as well as interviews of museum visitors, we have analysed how the installation supports sense-making, engaging conversations, and playful engagement.
        The role of an art center is to decompartmentalize, and this is why digital technology must take its place in 21st century exhibitions. Put at the service of creation, it becomes a formidable vector of dissemination, capable of creating bridges between eras, to make artistic practices vibrate between them, to amplify emotions, to reach as many people as possible.
        Emphasizing interactivity, immersive exhibitions offer a new way to access art. Discover how historians and specialists also desire to communicate pedagogy though these technology driven exhibitions
