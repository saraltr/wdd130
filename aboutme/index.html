        <div>
        <p>Hello Class! My name is Sara and I'm 24 years old.</p>
        <p>I was born in Colombia and remained there up to the age of six, when my mother and I moved to France.</p>
        <p>I have a prior degree in digital communication since I have always been attracted by new technologies, the web, and the world of computing.</p>
        <p>After completing Pathway Connect and CSE 110 last semester, which I really enjoyed, I decided to take advantage of this fantastic opportunity to enroll in BYU Idaho to study web and computer programming. I'm majoring in Applied technology which is very exciting to me! I've always been interested in web pages and application design & development, so I'm delighted to be taking this course!</p>
        <p>I love reading, cooking, gaming, spending time with my family, and my orange cat.</p>
